- `Project`: Supermarket Recommendation System
- `Project Description`:

> ACSE Supermarket, a company that sells everything, has over 40 stores in North America and sells over 100 thousand products in over 100 categories. ACSE customers can opt to join the ACSE Rewards program to avail of weekly sales and promotions. ACSE has determined that they can use a recommender system to help inform decisions such as products to carry in stores, shelf space allocation to products, products to promote to customers, reorder level of products, order quantity of products, etc.

> While ACSE traditionally relies on in-store promotions, they are now exploring personalized promotions in collaboration with select suppliers. Unlike generic promotions, personalized promotions target specific individuals based on their transaction history, maximizing the efficiency of promotional efforts. ACSE seeks to implement a recommender system to facilitate personalized promotions.

> Despite ongoing negotiations with suppliers, necessary data has been received from the client.

- `Project Objective`: Develop a recommender system for personalized promotions to target customers purchasing General Mills products for a personalized promotion for Kellogg.
